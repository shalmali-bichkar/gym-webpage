# Gym Website

I am currently learn web development and this is my first website. I have made it using HTML and CSS in VS-Code.

In this version, I'm using absolute positioning for placing the elements.

#### TODO:
1. Shift to flexbox instead of absolute positioning
2. Make all the web-pages
3. Add javascript
4. Responsive Styling
